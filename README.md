# EEG
Project in the Neural Networks and Deep Learning class. The goal is the implementation of deep learning models in order to categorize EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals sampled during the activation of different muscles in different subjectes. 
The files contain the predictive models (CNN, RNN, GRU) and a synthetic data generator (VAE).
